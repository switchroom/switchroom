# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Vault broker ACL was unconditionally denying every cron** in #113. The
  ACL matched `/proc/<pid>/exe` against the cron script path, but the
  generated systemd unit invokes `/bin/bash <script>`, so the kernel-set
  exe is `/bin/bash` and the path pattern never matched in production.
  Replaced with cgroup-based identity: peercred reads
  `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` to find the systemd unit name
  (`switchroom-<agent>-cron-<i>.service`), which systemd writes as root
  and processes cannot tamper with from userspace. Unit-test fixtures
  now exercise the full `ss -xpn` inode-pair lookup that production
  needs to map a connecting client back to its PID.
- **Peercred `ss` query was returning the broker's own PID.** The
  `src <socket>` filter selects the server-side row of a unix
  connection, whose `users:()` column is the listening process. The
  caller is the *client side*, identifiable by walking the inode pair
  in the same `ss -xpn` output. Fix lands the two-step lookup.

### Added
- `tests/integration/vault-broker-e2e.test.ts` — gated systemd e2e
  harness (set `INTEGRATION=1`). Spawns a real broker, places the cron
  in a transient `switchroom-<agent>-cron-0.service` via
  `systemd-run --user`, and proves end-to-end:
  - allowed-key happy path returns the value through the broker
  - disallowed-key path is denied with `ACL DENIED`, no value leaks
  - broker-stopped path fails loud (no silent fallback to interactive
    passphrase prompt in headless mode)

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `src/agents/create-orchestrator.ts` — new module with `createAgent()` and
  `completeCreation()` that sequences scaffold → systemd install → OAuth start
  → agent start in a single coherent flow. Used by the new `bootstrap` command
  and ready for the Phase 3 foreman bot.
- `switchroom agent bootstrap <name> --profile <p> --bot-token <t>` — one-shot
  CLI verb: scaffolds the agent, validates the BotFather token, starts an OAuth
  session, prints the URL to stdout, reads the code from stdin, and starts the
  agent. Passes `--rollback-on-fail` to remove the scaffold dir on auth failure
  (default: keep artefacts for retry).
- Phase 3a foreman bot skeleton with read-only fleet commands (status, list,
  logs) accessible over Telegram (#22).
- Phase 3b `/create-agent` multi-turn flow and destructive fleet commands
  (restart, stop, delete) with confirmation prompts (#27).
- Phase 4b operator-events: callback handler, IPC server/client, and history
  store for durable event tracking (#29).
- Telegram admin commands in gateway phase 1 — privileged bot commands routed
  directly through the gateway IPC (#33).

### Changed
- **BREAKING (upgrade note):** `scaffoldAgent()` no longer copies
  `~/.claude-home/.credentials.json` (or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`) into
  a new agent's `.claude/` directory. Each agent now gets its own fresh OAuth
  via `switchroom auth login <agent>` or `switchroom agent bootstrap <agent>`.
  Existing agents with their own `.oauth-token` or `.credentials.json` are
  unaffected — only the copy-on-scaffold step is removed.
- Scaffold and fixtures no longer embed personal implementation details;
  import overlay added for cleaner separation (#55, closes #48).
- Architecture doc added and README updated with compliance callout (#42).
- README hero image refreshed with Telegram highlight; compliance attestation
  updated for 2026-04-25 (#39).

### Fixed
- Progress-card orphan-defer race, label noise, and ghost replies resolved;
  multi-sub-agent invariant locked with regression tests (#49, closes #31 #41
  #43 #45).
- Progress-card retries bounded on Telegram 4xx errors (#10).
- Progress-card tool-name prefix stripped for human-authored labels (#9).
- Progress-card multi-sub-agent invariant test added (#12).
- CI unblocked: bktec brace-expansion + `advanceTimersByTimeAsync` polyfill
  (#54).
- CI unblocked: bktec parallelism fix + `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` stub (#38).
- Secret-detect: Anthropic OAuth browser code redaction added (#46).
- Auth: stale-token capture and `credentials.json` shadowing fixed (#40).
- Bootstrap: rollback scope widened, env-var token supported, missing outcome
  tests added (#20).
- Hardening: slug validation tightened, foreman state guards added,
  `callback_data` safety enforced (#25).
- Auth Phase 1: pane-ready probe, structured outcomes, and boot-sweep filter
  (#17).

## v0.2.5 — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Progress card no longer closes prematurely while background sub-agents are still running; deferred-completion visibility now waits for all active sub-agents before dismissing (#4).

### Changed
- MCP tool labels polished in the progress card for cleaner display.
- Preamble nudge added to scaffold to guide agent context on startup.

## v0.2.4 — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- gateway IPC socket cleanup race on `systemctl restart`: old gateway's delayed `unlinkSync` could arrive after the new gateway had already bound, deleting the new socket's filesystem entry and leaving an orphaned listener. Cleanup now renames the live socket to a `.bak` sidecar at both startup and shutdown so a late old-gateway cleanup cannot destroy the current generation's file; stale `.bak` is unlinked on the next startup when no one is using it.
- session-greeting hook no longer re-fires on every SessionStart when the gateway's socket path is unlinked (orphaned socket); idempotency guard now uses `ss` directly rather than a filesystem-existence check. Added structured logging to `session-greeting.log` for future diagnosability.

## v0.2.3 — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- gateway SIGTERM handler was clobbering stamped restart reasons, so greetings showed "clean shutdown" with no "why". Handler now preserves fresh reasons from any initiator and falls back to "systemctl: external restart" otherwise.

## v0.2.2 — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Removed absolute source paths baked into bundled output (build hygiene). The bundler was inlining `__filename` as a developer-machine absolute path inside `dist/cli/switchroom.js`. Switched `src/memory/scaffold-integration.ts` to `import.meta.dirname` so the resolved `switchroom-mcp/server.ts` anchor is computed at runtime from the bundle's own location. No published behaviour change, no new code paths.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-04-24

### Added
- Secret-detection pipeline: per-turn scanning of tool-use content with staging, rewrite, and audit log, plus PreToolUse and Stop hook scaffolding and a gateway-side intercept so leaked credentials are caught before they leave the agent (#47, #48, #49, #51, #54).
- `switchroom vault sweep` — retroactive scrubber that walks existing transcripts and vault-isches already-stored secrets in place (#50).
- Restart-reason surfaced in the session-greeting card so each agent's greeting tells you *why* the last restart happened (planned, crash, OOM, manual, etc.) (#58).

### Changed
- Telegram gateway hardening: startup mutex prevents duplicate bridges racing on launch, a 35s SIGTERM drain lets in-flight turns finish cleanly, and state transitions are now logged for post-mortems (#52, #53).
- CI pipeline: cache-aware `bun install` and serialized eval steps cut wall time and remove flakes from parallel runs (#57).
- Gateway wiring: pid-file, session-marker, and typing-wrap are now threaded through the gateway consistently (#45).

### Fixed
- "Recovered from unexpected restart" banner no longer fires on planned shutdowns — the 30s clean-shutdown marker preserve window aligns with the 60s banner-suppression window so orderly restarts stay quiet (#55).
- Regenerated `bun.lock` to match `package.json`, unbreaking Buildkite (#56).

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-23

Bumps the package to v0.2.0 and threads build provenance through to the greeting card so users can see which release each agent is running and how stale it is.
